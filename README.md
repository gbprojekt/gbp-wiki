## About GBP Wiki

<p>this project is my first Laravel project</p>
<p>
    in fact I took a look on Laravel already some years ago,<br />
    but I never found the time to go deeper into this framework and to finish a project
</p>
<br />
<p>
    in addition to Laravel I use Bootstrap.CSS and Tailwind.CSS for this project<br />
    I know both are CSS Frameworks to manage the Frontend<br />
    Bootstrap.CSS is mainly used to define the layout (grids), but I use also some design possibilites<br />
    I added Tailwind.CSS, because I wanted to learn how to use it and with this Framework I have more precise control for the design, if I need it
</p>
<br />
<p>this will be a very basic project</p>
<br />
<p>
    a wiki which includes a user authentication<br />
    this user authentication manage, which parts of the wiki a user has access to<br />
    therefore I use a package from Mateus Junges (https://github.com/mateusjunges/laravel-acl)
</p>
<br />
<p>
    I implemented in a first step 2 layers for the wiki
</p>
<ul>
    <li>category</li>
    <li>subcategory</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>
    the category represent the main navigation,<br />
    whereas the subcategory - if filled - is used to show a sub-navigation<br />
    this sub-navigation is the landing page after you clicked on a button of the main navigation<br />
    you will see a grid view with the sub-navigation - an image and a title represent a button<br />
    to save space - the image is hidden on the smartphone
