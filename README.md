## About GBP Wiki

<p>this project is my first Laravel project</p>
<p>
    in fact I took a look on Laravel already some years ago,<br />
    but I never found the time to go deeper into this framework and to finish a project
</p>
<br />
<p>
    in addition to Laravel I use Bootstrap.CSS and Tailwind.CSS for this project<br />
    I know both are CSS Frameworks to manage the Frontend<br />
    Bootstrap.CSS is mainly used to define the layout (grids), but I use also some design possibilites<br />
    I added Tailwind.CSS, because I wanted to learn how to use it and with this Framework I have more precise control for the design, if I need it
</p>
<br />
<p>this will be a very basic project</p>
<br />
<p>
    a wiki which includes a user authentication<br />
    this user authentication manage, which parts of the wiki a user has access to<br />
    therefore I use a package from Mateus Junges (https://github.com/mateusjunges/laravel-acl)
</p>
<br />
<p>
    under construction
