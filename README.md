## About GBP Wiki

<p>this project is my first Laravel project - which I will finish ;-)</p>
<p>
    in fact I took a look on Laravel already some years ago,<br />
    but I never found the time to go deeper into this framework
</p>
<p>
    this will be a very basic project<br />
    a wiki which includes a user authentication<br />
    this user authentication manage, which parts of the wiki a user has access to
</p>
<p>
    I implemented in a first step 2 layers for the wiki
</p>
<ul>
    <li>category</li>
    <li>subcategory</li>
</ul>
<p>
    the category represent the main navigation,<br />
    whereas the subcategory - if filled - is used to show a sub-navigation<br />
    this sub-navigation is the landing page after you clicked on a button of the main navigation<br />
    you will see a grid view with the sub-navigation - an image and a title represent a button<br />
    to save space - the image is hidden on the smartphone
